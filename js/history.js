    Julius Caesar and his Roman army campaigned in Gaul between 58 and 53 BC under the pretext of protecting the territory from Germanic invaders,
     but in reality to conquer it and annex it to the Roman Republic. In the summer of 53 BC, he visited the city and addressed the delegates of the Gallic tribes
      assembled before the temple to ask them to contribute soldiers and money to his campaign. Wary of the Romans, the Parisii listened politely to Caesar,
       offered to provide some cavalry, but formed a secret alliance with the other Gallic tribes, under the leadership of Vercingetorix, and launched an 
       uprising against the Romans in January 52 BC.

Caesar responded quickly. He force-marched six legions north to Orléans, where the rebellion had begun, and then to Gergovia, the home of Vercingetorix.
 At the same time, he sent his deputy Titus Labienus with four legions to subdue the Parisii and their allies, the Senons. The Commander of the Parisii,
  Camulogene, burned the bridge that connected the oppidum to the left bank of the Seine, so the Romans were unable to approach the town.
   Then Labienus and the Romans went downstream, built their own pontoon bridge at Melun and approached Lutetia on the right bank. 
   Camulogene responded by burning the bridge to the right bank and burning the town, before retreating to the left bank and making camp at what is now 
   Saint-Germain-des-Prés.

    They also built the Basilica of Saint-Denis, which became the necropolis of the kings of France. None of the Merovingian buildings survived, 
    but there are four marble Merovingian columns in the church of Saint-Pierre de Montmartre. The kings of the Merovingian dynasty were buried in the Abbey 
    of Saint-Germain-des Prés, however Dagobert I, the last king of the Merovingian dynasty, who died in 639, was the first Frankish king to be buried in the
     Basilica of Saint-Denis.

The kings of the Carolingian dynasty, who came to power in 751, moved the Frankish capital to Aix-la-Chapelle (Aachen) and paid little attention to Paris, 
though King Pepin the Short did build an impressive new sanctuary at Saint-Denis, which was consecrated in the presence of Charlemagne on 24 February 775.

In the 9th century, the city was repeatedly attacked by the Vikings, 
who sailed up the Seine on great fleets of Viking ships. They demanded a ransom and ravaged the fields. In 857, Björn Ironside almost destroyed the city.
 In 885–886, they laid a one-year siege to Paris and tried again in 887 and in 889, but were unable to conquer the city, as it was protected by
  the Seine and the walls of the Île de la Cité. The two bridges, vital to the city, were additionally protected by two massive stone fortresses, 
  the Grand Châtelet on the Right Bank and the "Petit Châtelet" on the Left Bank, built on the initiative of Joscelin, the bishop of Paris. The Grand Châtelet
   gave its name to the modern Place du Châtelet on the same site.

    To re-establish order in the unruly city, he abolished the elected position of the Mayor of Paris, and replaced it with a Prefect of the Seine appointed by
     him on 17 February 1800. The first prefect, Louis Nicolas Dubois, was appointed on 8 March 1800 and held his position until 1810. Each of the twelve 
     arrondissements had its own mayor, but their power was limited to enforcing the decrees of Napoleon's ministers.

After he crowned himself Emperor on 2 December 1804, Napoleon began a series of projects to make Paris into an imperial capital to rival 
ancient Rome. He began construction of the Rue de Rivoli, from the Place de la Concorde to the Place des Pyramides. The old convent of the Capucines was
 demolished, and he built a new street that connected Place Vendôme to the Grands Boulevards. The street was called the "Rue Napoléon", later renamed the Rue 
 de la Paix.

In 1802, Napoleon built a revolutionary iron bridge, the Pont des Arts, across the Seine. It was decorated with two greenhouses of 
exotic plants and rows of orange trees. Passage across the bridge cost one sou. He gave the names of his victories to two new bridges,
 the Pont d'Austerlitz (1802) and the Pont d'Iéna (1807)

    The building is now the Musée de Montmartre.[149] Pablo Picasso, Amedeo Modigliani and other artists lived and worked in a building called
     Le Bateau-Lavoir during the years 1904–1909. In this building, Picasso painted one of his most important masterpieces, Les Demoiselles d'Avignon.

Several noted composers, including Erik Satie, also lived in this neighborhood. Most of the artists left after the outbreak of World War I,
 the majority of them to take up residence in the Montparnasse quarter.

On 25 December 1895, the Grand Café on the Boulevard des Capucines was the location of the first public projection of a motion picture, 
this one produced by the Lumière Brothers. Thirty-three spectators paid one franc each to see a series of short films, beginning with a film
 of workers leaving the Lumière brothers' factory in Lyon.
At the outset of the 20th century, Henri Matisse and several other artists, including the pre-cubists Georges Braque, André Derain, 
Raoul Dufy, Jean Metzinger and Maurice de Vlaminck, revolutionized the Paris art world with "wild", multi-coloured, expressive landscapes and 
figure paintings that critics referred to as Fauvism. Henri Matisse's two versions of The Dance signified a key point in his career and in the 
development of modern painting.
